For more options use the -h option.

You can edit the config.ini file to configure the application. Most of the features aren't coded yet but in order to find out about the options, you can checkout the modules in different folders. For example, we have two Evolver modules right now which can be found in the Evolver folder. The module name can be used as a configuration parameter.
